# TubularShunt
A Discrete Fourier Transform Approach using Python:

By knowing the transfer function (complex transfer impedance) of a Tubular Shunt according to the simplified equivalent circuit (P-Quadrapole) we can take, by applying Inverse Laplace Transform, the impulse impedance h(t) of the shunt.
By applying Discrete Fourier Transform on the signal h(t) we can derive all the information about the magnitude |H(jÏ‰)| of the shunt in frequency domain.
Here i show the code in python of a real application along with the figures after running the program. Below is a simulation on the equivalent circuit.
