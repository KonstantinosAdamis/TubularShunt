# TubularShunt
A Discrete Fourier Transform Approach using Python:

By knowing the transfer function (complex transfer impedance) of a Tubular Shunt according to the simplified equivalent circuit (P-Quadrapole) we can take, by applying Inverse Laplace Transform, the impulse impedance h(t) of the shunt.
By applying Discrete Fourier Transform in the signal h(t) we can derive all the information about the magnitude in frequency domain.
Here i show the code in python of a real application along with the figures after running the program. Below is a simulation of the equivalent circuit in Multisim.
