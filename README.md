# TubularShunt
A Discrete Fourier Transform Approach using Python:

If we know the transfer function H(s) of a Tubular Shunt according to the simplified equivalent circuit (P-Quadrapole) we can take, by applying Inverse Laplace Transform, the impulse impedance h(t) of the shunt.
By applying Discrete Fourier Transform on h(t) we can take all the information about the magnitude of the |H(jÏ‰)|.
Here i show the code in python of a real application along with the extracted figures after running the program.

Note: H(s) = R^2/(2R+sL)
