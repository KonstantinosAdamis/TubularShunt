# TubularShunt
A Discrete Fourier Transform Approach using Python:

Having the transfer function of a Tubular Shunt according to the simplified equivalent circuit (P-Quadrapole) we can find the impulse impedance h(t).
Applying Discrete Fourier Transform in the signal h(t) we can derive all the information about the magnitude in frequency domain.
Here i show the code in python of a real application along with the figures after running the program. Below is a simulation of the equivalent circuit in Multisim. It is noticed that tubular shunt behaves as a low-pass filter.
